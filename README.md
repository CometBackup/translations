## Help translate Comet

We're committed to making Comet available in different languages.

Our first option is to translate in-house. Mostly our staff speak English, so, we are limited in what we can do.

Our second option is to contract an external company to provide translations. However, such companies are often not aware of specific technical terms, or how things work in this industry.

Hence we turn to our third option: our customers. You know the industry; you know the software; you know the language. If you want to help improve Comet, we would really appreciate any language translation assistance you can offer.

## How to help

Comet uses the industry-standard Gettext (`.po`) file format for translations. You can [download the files](https://github.com/CometBackup/translations/archive/master.zip) and edit them with a free tool like [PoEdit](https://poedit.net/) or even a plain-text editor like Notepad or Vim.

You can modify the existing translation for a file (such as `comet.nl_NL.po` for Dutch) or, create a new language translation from the `.pot` file.

Please modify the included files, and either 
- send them back to us via the support ticket system at [CometBackup.com](https://cometbackup.com/), or
- create a pull request on GitHub.

We will include your translation in the next available version of Comet.
